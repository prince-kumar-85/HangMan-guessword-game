# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a classic word-guessing game where you try to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: When you open the game, a random word will be selected from a predefined list. You will see a series of blank spaces representing the letters of the word.

2. **Guess Letters**: Use the on-screen keyboard to guess letters. Click on a letter to make a guess. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s). If the letter is not in the word, it will count as an incorrect guess.

3. **Track Progress**: The hangman image will update with each incorrect guess. You can see the number of incorrect guesses you have made out of the maximum allowed (6).

4. **Hints**: A hint related to the word will be displayed to help you guess the word.

5. **Game Over**: The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or use up all your incorrect guesses. If you guess the word, you win! If you use up all your guesses, you lose, and the correct word will be revealed.

6. **Play Again**: After the game ends, you can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game with a different word.

## Rules

1. You can only guess one letter at a time.
2. Each incorrect guess will add a part to the hangman image.
3. You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the game is over.
4. Use the hint provided to help you guess the word.
5. The game is won if you guess all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
6. The game is lost if you reach the maximum number of incorrect guesses without guessing the word.
